# Agent Guide

When reporting information to me, be extremely concise and scrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

**Always invoke the `frontend-design` skill** before writing any frontend code. No exceptions.

When writing React code, always use the `vercel-react-best-practice` skill.

Always use Vanilla CSS; no frameworks

Animations should use Framer Montion's `animate` and the `framer-motion-animator` skill.

For writing and configuring tests use the `vitest` skill.

For building and running the project use the `vite` skill.

After changes, make sure to run `pnpm run build` and resolve any errors.

Always use the `pnpm` command instead of `npm`
